/**
 * SPEC-step27.md §2 — turns every manual ("tay") canvas mutation into a
 * `PatchOp` logged to `workflow_changes` via `POST /api/workflows/:id/changes`
 * (routes/changes.ts, SPEC-step22.md §5), so the AI reads it back next turn
 * through `changeDigest.ts` and the user gets an undo path (`revertChange`,
 * wired in `HistoryPanel.tsx`).
 *
 * A pure module — no React, no store of its own. `store/flow.ts`'s mutators
 * call the scheduling functions below right after applying their change
 * locally (same "optimistic first, server reconciles after" shape as
 * `applyOptimisticOp`/`chatTurn`, SPEC-step26.md); this module owns only the
 * queueing/debounce/version-chain/rebase plumbing.
 *
 * Post-review fixes (this file's own header used to say every read below was
 * "fresh via getState() at send time, never captured at schedule time" — that
 * was itself the bug): `expectedVersion` is still correctly read fresh at
 * send time (that's what keeps the version chain correct across several
 * entries *for the same workflow*), but WHICH workflow an entry belongs to
 * must be captured at schedule time and never re-derived later — otherwise a
 * conversation switch mid-debounce (or mid-queue, for a slow in-flight
 * request) sends an op meant for workflow A to whatever workflow happens to
 * be current by the time the entry actually fires. Every entry now carries
 * its own `workflowId`, captured at the moment the user acted (schedule time
 * for the two debounced mutators, call time for the five immediate ones —
 * see `store/flow.ts`'s call sites), and `processEntry`/`handleConflict`
 * refuse to send (or act on a conflict for) an entry whose captured
 * `workflowId` no longer matches the live canvas.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT used by JSON-view edits or workflow rename (SPEC-step27.md
 * §4 "hạn chế ghi nhận có chủ đích" / §3 scope) — those keep the pre-existing
 * PUT `saveWorkflow()` path.
 *
 * `autoLayout()` (SPEC-step16.md §3) is a partial exception, resolved in
 * SPEC-step31.md F7: the Toolbar's manual "🪄 Sắp xếp" click (its `opts.log`
 * default) DOES batch every moved node into one `move-node` entry here, same
 * as a drag. `store/chat.ts`'s OTHER call to `autoLayout()` — the automatic
 * coarse re-layout that runs after every AI turn's `onMessage` — passes
 * `{ log: false }` and keeps the old `dirty: true` fallback instead: logging
 * that one here would mislabel an AI-turn side effect as a manual edit.
